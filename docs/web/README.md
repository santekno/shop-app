# JavaScript and TypeScript for Go developers

Bab 7 teaches the JavaScript and TypeScript that the GoShop web code uses every day. This note is the map: what changes when you come from Go, and where each idea lives in the code.

## The mental model

| Go | JavaScript / TypeScript | What it means in GoShop |
|---|---|---|
| Types are checked by the compiler **and** exist at run time | TypeScript types are checked by `tsc`, then **erased**; the browser runs plain JavaScript | A response is only as correct as the API. Types come from `api/openapi.yaml`, never written by hand |
| `go build` produces one binary | Vite bundles modules into static files; Node 24 can run a `.ts` file directly by stripping its types | `packages/shared` has no build step: apps and Node import its `.ts` source |
| `int`, `int64`, `float64` are different types | `number` is always a 64-bit float; integers are exact only up to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 − 1) | Money is whole rupiah (`amount`), far below 2^53, so a `number` holds it exactly |
| Every variable has a zero value | A missing value is `undefined`, an explicit "nothing" is `null` | The API sends `null` (`parent_id`, `next_cursor`); optional fields in our options are `undefined` |
| `==` compares values of one type | `==` converts types first (`0 == ""` is `true`); `===` does not | Always `===`, enforced by the `eqeqeq` lint rule |
| Errors are values: `v, err := f()` | Errors are thrown and caught with `try`/`catch`; a rejected promise is an error | The API client throws one error type, `ApiError`, for every failure |
| Goroutines run in parallel on many threads | One thread runs an **event loop**; `await` yields until a promise settles | No locks, but never block the thread with long synchronous work |
| `context.Context` cancels work | `AbortController` / `AbortSignal` cancel a `fetch` | Every client call takes a `signal`; timeouts abort the request |
| Packages, `import "path"` | ES modules, `import { x } from "./file.ts"` | One public entry point per package (`packages/shared/src/index.ts`) |
| Methods on structs, interfaces satisfied implicitly | Functions and objects; TypeScript types are **structural** too | The client is a plain object returned by a function, not a class hierarchy |

## Where each article's ideas live

Every concept of Bab 7 is in code the storefront runs, not in a sandbox. Paths are relative to the repository root.

| Article | Concept | Where to read it |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | The mental model above | this file |
| 02 | `const`, arrow functions, closures | `createUrlBuilder` in `packages/shared/src/api/url.ts` (the returned function closes over the checked base URL); `let` only where a value changes: the loop counter in `retry` (`packages/shared/src/lib/async.ts`) |
| 03 | Destructuring, default parameters, spread, rest | `for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(query))` and `query = {}` in `url.ts`; option destructuring with defaults in `createApiClient` and `request` (`packages/shared/src/api/client.ts`); `{ ...init, signal }` in `send`; `...codes` rest parameter in `isApiError` (`packages/shared/src/api/errors.ts`) |
| 04 | `map`, `filter`, `reduce` | `buildCategoryTree` in `packages/shared/src/catalog/category-tree.ts`; `nodes.map` rendering in `apps/web/src/features/catalog/components/CategoryTree.tsx` |
| 05 | ES modules: `import`/`export`, `import type`, one entry point | `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, `"exports"` and `"sideEffects"` in `packages/shared/package.json`; `@goshop/shared` imports in `apps/web/src` |
| 06 | Promises, `async`/`await` vs goroutines | `sleep` (a promise built by hand, abortable like `select` on `ctx.Done()`) and `retry` (`return await` inside `try`) in `async.ts`; the effect in `apps/web/src/features/catalog/hooks/useCategoryTree.ts` |
| 07 | `fetch`, error handling, timeouts | `send`/`readResponse` in `client.ts` (`AbortController` per attempt, `finally` as `defer`); the `ApiError` class and the `isErrorBody` run-time check in `errors.ts`; `errorMessage` in `apps/web/src/lib/error-message.ts` |
| 08 | `type`, `interface`, unions, narrowing | `HttpMethod` in `client.ts`; `ServerErrorCode`, `ClientErrorCode`, `ApiErrorCode` and the `isApiError` type guard in `errors.ts`; the `AsyncState<T>` discriminated union in `useCategoryTree.ts` |
| 09 | Generics vs Go generics | `retry<T>` in `packages/shared/src/lib/async.ts` (T flows in from the function argument) vs `request<T>` in `client.ts` (T only in the result: a promise the caller makes); `AsyncState<T>` in `useCategoryTree.ts` |
| 10 | `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit` (and `Readonly`, `ReturnType`) | `ApiClientOptions`, `DEFAULTS`, `RequestOptions` and `ApiClient` in `client.ts`; `EndpointOptions` in `packages/shared/src/api/catalog.ts` |
| 11 | Types generated from OpenAPI | `packages/shared/src/api/schema.gen.ts` (never edited), the aliases in `types.ts`, `listCategories` in `catalog.ts`; `make gen-types` writes it, `make gen-types-check` (part of `make lint`) fails when it is stale |
| 12 | Vite + React + TS project | `apps/web`: `vite.config.ts` (alias, port 5173, the `VITE_API_URL` build check), `tsconfig.app.json`, `src/config.ts`, `src/vite-env.d.ts`; container in `apps/web/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Caddyfile` |
| 13 | ESLint, Prettier, team rules | `apps/web/eslint.config.js`, `packages/shared/eslint.config.js`, the `lint`/`format`/`test:unit` scripts |
| 14 | Asking AI to explain confusing JS | no code; `docs/ai-rules.md` |
| 15 | Recap: a typed GoShop API client | `createApiClient` + `listCategories`, used by `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` and `useCategoryTree` |

## Running a file directly

`packages/shared` has no build step. Node 24 strips the types and runs a `.ts` file as it is, which is handy for trying an idea from an article:

```bash
node -e 'import("./packages/shared/src/index.ts").then(({ buildCategoryTree }) =>
  console.log(buildCategoryTree([{ id: "1", slug: "a", name: "A", parent_id: null }])))'
```

That works because the package only uses syntax that disappears when types are removed (`erasableSyntaxOnly`: no `enum`, no `namespace`) and names every relative import with its `.ts` extension.
